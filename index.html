        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p><strong>Role: </strong>This was a group project where the team shared similar responsibilities in UX Research, Design, Prototyping, and Usability Testing.<br><strong>Team: </strong>The team consisted of Alicia Abelow, Stephen Harrison, and myself.</p>
        <ul><strong>Tools Used</strong>
            <li>Miro</li>
            <li>Zoom</li>
            <li>Slack</li>
            <li>Google Drive</li>
            <li>Adobe XD</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Background</strong><br>As a team, we were tasked with coming up with a new mobile app that has not been created. While brainstorming together we realized that we all grew up and owned dogs as well as cared for physical health in our communities. The three of us took time to fill out a competitor analysis of the high ranked dog apps on our mobile devices, noticing a common theme that they all were designed around getting a caretaker for your furry companion. After finding this insight, we knew what had to be done… From there, PupNav was created. </p>

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>Two different research methods were used to obtain key user insights. There were 8 user interviews that were held over Zoom with the below objectives, as well as online research. We wanted to gain a deeper understanding of what we were doing to empathize with the user and come up with an app that will help others.</p>
        <div>
            <ul><strong>Interview Objectives</strong>
                <li>Feelings and frustrations finding dog friendly locations.</li>
                <li>Thoughts on socializing with their dog.</li>
                <li>Health habits in relation with their dog.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <ul><strong>Key Insights</strong>
                <li>15% national increase in pet adoption due to pandemic.</li>
                <li>Users have a strong love for dogs and include them on their daily tasks.</li>
                <li>There's not one place to look up dog and human needs easily.</li>
                <li>Incorporate physical activities and health goals.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Ideation</h1>
        <p>After identifying our user, Ashley Madox, we started to define a user flow. This sections of the project gave us some issues. After a few iterations of the user flow, we finally came across a “happy path” for Ashley Madox.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p><strong>Paper Prototype</strong><br>From the start we all had some great ideas for the layout of our app. As we compared design the design of our app took place. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <p>With our paper prototypes completed, PupNav has started to become digital. With lo-fidelity wireframes in place we are able to see things come to life. We started to test our design to see how easy the navigation would be with user tests. </p>
        <div>
            <img src="" alt="">

        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Once we had our first run of wireframes created we started to put the design to work with usability tests. Throughout these tests we were able to gain great insight from those that would be using the app. This task helped the team to streamline the design keeping it still fun and modern but also accessible and usable. </p>
        <p><strong>Usability Testing</strong><br>In our first lo-fidelity user testing we discovered that our users completed the onboarding section with 50% accuracy and were able to complete "finding your health information" and "can you complete your first walk" with 100% accuracy. From there we did get feedback about some button placements, steps, and found out each task took longer than what was anticipated. Our second user test lead to an increase in finishing the tasks as well as in understanding each task. In our second user test our users had difficulty understanding the horizontal and vertical slide feature in our app. With finishing our 3rd user tests we found that our placements of the horizontal and vertical scrolling made it easier to identify their functionality.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Iterations</h1>
        <p>We conducted 3 different usability tests, after each one making changes to our design and then testing again to see how accessible the design was. As we were going through our tests, we noticed that even though our first design was fun and different, we needed to streamline the path to make it more usable to our users. </p>

        <h1>Final</h1>
        <div>
            <p>We have reached a final prototype for the project. After taking in feedback from our peers we were able to create a final design that we are all proud of. From creating small micro-interaction to what our logo would be, PupNav was able to breath and become one step closer to a final product. Throughout the project my team and I all worked on each step of the design process together, taking some tasks on our own and then coming together for constructive feedback and iterations that could be made. </p>

        <p><strong>Future Iterations</strong><br>This app has great potential with the newly found dog owners of the world. There are small iterations that could be made to not only bring money to the app but also bring in new technology. Local companies can promote within the app as a rest stop for you and your dog as you are on your walk. A premium version that records your walk so you can share a 3D rendition with friends. With technology permitting, you could take GPS Collars and link them to the app so you can tell where your dog is if they decide to run after a squirrel. </p>
        <p><strong>Reflections</strong><br>Throughout working on this project with my team there were some great challenges with finding time to work together on the project and being within scope of the project. <br>We all had busy schedules with our jobs as well as personal life. We created a scheduled that we would meet at 8pm every other night in order to talk about the project and work on the sections we were assigned. This helped us not only brainstorm and think together, but also grow as a team. <br>With this project being open to our teams interpretation it was difficult to make sure that we would incorporate needed features without getting too deep in the rabbit hole and getting out of our scope. This relied heavily on all of our team members to questions the feature we were adding and if it was necessary to our design at the time. </p>
